## Speech-to-Text

For supported browsers, this will convert speech to text and append it to an input field.

Note, while some WebKit based browsers will pass the tests for support, they will not work since they do not provide an API on the backend to convert speech to text.
For example, Brave and Vivaldi both show the STT button, but nothing happens when speaking.
